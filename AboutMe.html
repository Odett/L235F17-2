<!-- tables are a super useful way of organizing content on the web. besides text, you can also put images, animations, sounds, and videos in tables! -->

<table border="1"> <!-- the '1' sets the width of the border. you can also make a table without a visible border, just change the '1' to a '0' -->
<tr> <!-- begins a new table row -->
<td>A</td> <!-- creates a new table divider -->
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr> <!-- ends the first row -->
<tr> <!-- begins the second row -->
<td>D</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr> <!-- ends the second row -->
</table> <!-- closes the table -->

<!-- there's plenty of other ways to mess around with your text besides these. if you find yourself wanting to do something you don't already know how to do, just search for your question or a keyword with the word "HTML." There are plenty of resources online for learning a lot more about HTML than this little webpage could teach you. -->
